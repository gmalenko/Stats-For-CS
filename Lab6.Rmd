population <- ames$Gr.Liv.Area
samp <- sample(population, 60)
```

##Exercise 1: Plot a histogram of your sample of living areas. Then, describe the shape, center, and spread of your histogram. What would you say is the "typical" living area within your sample? Explain.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
hist(samp)
```
### Exercise 1 Answer

##Exercise 2: Would you expect another student's sample distribution to be identical to yours? Would you expect it to be similar? Why or why not?

###Exercise 2 Answer: No. 

###Confidence Intervals
```{r, cache=TRUE}
sample_mean <- mean(samp)
se <- sd(samp)/sqrt(60)
lower <- sample_mean - 2 * se
upper <- sample_mean + 2 * se
c(lower, upper)
```
