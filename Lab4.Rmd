##Exercise 1: Generate separate histograms of the men's and women's heights. Then, compare and contrast the center, spread, and shape of these two height distributions. 


```{r}
#Male Height
hist(mdims$hgt, main = "Men's Hight in CM", xlab = "Height(cm)")
summary(mdims$hgt) # 5 Number Summary of Men's Height in cM.
```

```{r}
#Female Height
hist(fdims$hgt, main = "Women's Hight in CM", xlab = "Height(cm)")
summary(fdims$hgt) # 5 Number Summary of Women's Height in cM.
```
###The men's distribution appears to be symmetical while the womens distribution is skewed left.  The Men's median is 177.8 while the Women's is 164.5.
